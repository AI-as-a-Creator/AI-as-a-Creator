<h2 id="wilbur">Wilbur</h2>
<p>There was once a clever owl named Wilbur, who lived in the local zoo. Wilbur was unusually wise, often finding himself coming up with imaginative schemes. It wasn&rsquo;t until one fateful day that Wilbur came up with an idea to escape the zoo.</p>
<p>Gathering his wits and resources, Wilbur opened the latch on his cage when the zookeepers weren&rsquo;t looking. He was free. Wilbur flew over the perimeter fence and quickly made his way to the nearby forest.</p>
<p>Wilbur had never been this far from the zoo before and was in awe of the lush vegetation and the variety of wildlife. Wilbur eventually stumbled upon an old abandoned barn, and instead of flying away, he chose to stay for a while.</p>
<p>He quickly befriended the farmer who used the barn and made a cozy nest in a corner of the barn. Wilbur was happy for the first time since coming to the zoo and lived out his days on the farm, far away from his prison-like cage.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="black-dog">Black Dog</h2>
<p>Jack pulled up in his truck and stepped out, whistling as he surveyed the property. He had been restoring the old house for nearly a year, and it was finally nearing completion. But, as he rounded the corner of the weathered barn, he found himself facing a terrifying sight. An enormous, coal-black dog with wild eyes, saliva dripping from its jowls and an unmistakably angry expression. He froze and tried to back away, but the dog snarled and charged forward. Jack knew this was no ordinary animal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s owners had disappeared months ago, leaving the monstrous beast tied up in the barn. It had become emaciated and mean spirited, the violence gleaming in its eyes. He had to escape. So, Jack ran for his life, the huge dog snapping at his heels the entire way. Luck paid off and he managed to reach his truck in time. Slamming the door and locking it, he raced off the property.</p>
<p>He had no idea what happened to the angry dog, but he dared not go back. He dreaded the day he would find out.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="kenyan-pigeon">Kenyan Pigeon</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a cheerful little bird from the lands of the Southern regions of Kenya. He was not your everyday run of the mill pigeon, but rather a highly resourceful and ebullient being, who could brighten up even the dreariest of days.</p>
<p>Winter in the Southern regions of Kenya can sometimes be quite harsh and troublesome. However, that never effected this happy little bird. He spent his days fluttering around his habitat and singing cheerfully, despite the extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>The bird was highly admired by his community. He often stopped by the human residence to pay a visit and they would feed him boiled peanuts and maize. After his visit, the little bird kept the humans company with his sweet chirps, while they did their chores.</p>
<p>The bird was, without a doubt, the happiest being in the Southern regions of Kenya. He didn&rsquo;t require any material possessions as he was content with the simple pleasures in life.</p>
<p>He taught us to appreciate the little things and to have a positive outlook on life. He was a constant source of joy and it was always such a pleasure to have him about. His presence was a reminder that the dark clouds of life can be swept away, just by believing in the power of hope and joy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="escape-plan">Escape Plan</h2>
<p>Once upon a dark night in the zoo, a clever owl was planning his escape. He noticed the security guards all followed the same pattern every night; they would patrol, then go back to the guard house and have dinner.</p>
<p>He would use this to his advantage. One night after dinner, the owl flew around and collected a variety of materials for a makeshift rope: cloth and metal strapping from the booths in the petting zoo, sticks and vines from mossy old trees and grass surrounding the cages.</p>
<p>Finally, he crafted the rope from his materials, quickly and quietly. The owl stretched the rope across a tight gap between two of the highest buildings, tying it to a nearby tree. He stepped onto the rope, and cautiously began climbing over the wall.</p>
<p>When he reached the top, he took a look back at the zoo, smugly proud of his abilities. The owl&rsquo;s daring and creative plan had paid off, and the success of his escape would surely be remembered in the zoo&rsquo;s history books.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="misunderstood">Misunderstood</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an angry dog that seemed to be bigger than usual. He was a formidable sight, with huge muscles, powerful jaws, and deep brown eyes that seemed to smolder. Whenever he would growl and bark, the sound seemed to fill the entire room.</p>
<p>The poor pup had been abandoned by its original owners and taken in by an animal shelter. It was there that he had developed a grudge against humans due to his mistreatment, and he had a hard time trusting anyone.</p>
<p>The shelter workers, desperate to find a home for him, eventually posted an advert online. One family, unafraid of the animal&rsquo;s brash demeanor, adopted him. They named him Hercules and loved him despite his size and temper. He was welcomed into the family with open arms and lots of hugs and kisses.</p>
<p>Hercules learned to trust his new owners after time, and his full and playful demeanor was revealed. He even became quite protective of those that he loved, despite his aggressive nature.</p>
<p>Hercules' story serves as an important reminder: all animals deserve love, patience, and respect, no matter how intimidating they may seem.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="happily-waiting">Happily Waiting</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, in a pond far away, a happy frog patiently waited for her friend. She was happily hopping in circles, perching herself gracefully on lily pads and singing. Every time she sung, it put a smile on her face, as she reminded herself of why she was waiting.</p>
<p>Her friend was coming over to join her for a picnic. They had been planning this for weeks and it was finally happening! The frog was in utter excitement; she had packed the whole pond with her favorite fruits and vegetables like dragon fruits, grapes, and carrots for them to nibble on.</p>
<p>Finally, there it was, her friend hopping alongside her. The little frog was so overjoyed that she jumped for joy and hugged her friend tightly. Now the two of them could enjoy their picnic together, taking in the beauty of their pond, not having a care in the world.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="golden-rule">Golden Rule</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there lived a man with a great fortune who lived a life of high society. Despite his wealth and position, he lived a life of poverty and despair. Despair stemmed from a lack of kind interactions with his fellow man.</p>
<p>The man decided to seek out the wisdom of a wise man to learn the secrets of true happiness. The wise man told the man about the golden rule: &ldquo;Treat others as you would have them treat you&rdquo;. The man was taken aback, as he has never heard of anything like this before. He couldn&rsquo;t fathom how he could have been so unaware of something this simple yet extraordinary.</p>
<p>He realized that true wealth and happiness did not come from ego, vanity or materialism, but from meaningful relationships with other people. He decided to give back to his community and open his heart and door to others. The man quickly found himself surrounded by loving friends, in a world filled with joy, peace and harmony.</p>
<p>The wise man had taught him the truth of the golden rule, and the man followed it to make his life much richer than he ever imagined it could be. And so, the golden rule became imperative to him, and he made sure to always pass it on to others.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cracked">Cracked</h2>
<p>It had been a long and tedious day of work. Tired and exhausted, Anastasia sighed as she watched her Samsung HD Monitor flicker and faintly fade to black. Anxiety crept up in the pit of her stomach as she realized the top-right corner of the monitor was cracked. Sighing, she pushed her chair away from the desk and stood up with a heavy heart. Anastasia knew what this meant for her; she had to break the bad news to her boss someday.</p>
<p>She had bought this for the office a few years ago, when it first came out, and it had served them well. But here she was, looking at a cracked monitor, with no backup plan, especially with the budget cuts from the office. She had been boasting about the features and everything it could do, but all of her touting had come to this.</p>
<p>Anastasia took a deep breath, then slowly shuffled out of the office while taking one last glance at the cracked monitor screen. All she could do now was hope that she&rsquo;d somehow figure out a way to fix it, or at least get a replacement. Either way, it seemed like this macabre moment of gloom was here to stay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="precious-story">Precious Story</h2>
<p>Sam was a simple man who had never been to school, but he loved to explore the old abandoned village at the edge of town. One day as he was fishing, he stumbled across an old book that was half-buried in the dirt. Curious, he picked it up and rubbed the cover. It was inscribed with a language he did not recognize.</p>
<p>Even though he couldn&rsquo;t read the words, the pictures in the book stirred something in Sam&rsquo;s heart. He turned the pages and imagined a story for each illustration. He vowed to keep the book forever, even though he couldn&rsquo;t decipher what was written inside.</p>
<p>Years later, a young scholar from the nearby university was exploring the ruins and stumbled across Sam&rsquo;s book. He was amazed to find such an exquisite example of ancient writing. He asked Sam if he had been the one to discover it, and then explained to Sam that the book was filled with a precious story, written long ago.</p>
<p>Sam was delighted to hear this, although he could not understand the tale. He was happy just to know that such a beautiful story was inside. From then on, Sam continued to explore the ruins in search of more lost books.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dance-of-the-tissue">Dance of the Tissue</h2>
<p>A used tissue floated through the warm summer air, soaring above the stretch of forest below. The wind pushed it upward and upward, creating an ever lasting updraft. As the tissue felt no weight holding it down, it spread out, creating a makeshift kite for the birds below.</p>
<p>The tissue twirled and spun, as if in a dance, ever higher and higher. Above the clouds, the tissue felt the true beauty of freedom, free from the bounds of gravity that pull us back to the ground. It soared above the heights of any mountain peaks, a bright white spot against a bright blue sky.</p>
<p>As it came to the end of its journey, the air began to cool and the tissue soon fell back to Earth. Even though its journey had been brief, it left an imprint, a reminder of its time in flight. The tissue had offered a brief glimpse of something that felt impossible, to feel like a bird, weightless and free of all the worries of the world below.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="old-mouse">Old Mouse</h2>
<p>The old mouse wandered through the fields, feeling the cool summer breeze on its face. The sun was beginning to set and a feeling of nostalgia had already come to fill the air. She was alone yet surrounded by a symphony of nature and life, no longer able to keep up with her younger, more daring brethren that once bounced around these fields.</p>
<p>Still, she walked, a reminder of life&rsquo;s transient nature - impermanence. As she thought on the old days, when she would scamper and run, the old mouse felt a sense of peace. She accepted her place in the world: she was aging, and this, too, was part of the cycle of life.</p>
<p>She continued to travel at her own pace, watching the landscape change with the setting sun and feeling more content. There was joy in living the moment, in appreciating existence, and in knowing that life will never remain the same. Even if her time was coming to an end, the mouse had had an eternity of love and joy - and that was enough.</p>

<h2 id="new-web-developer">New Web Developer</h2>
<p>A new web developer to the land,
Though striving hard to understand,
Learned when the coding seemed absurd,
That life&rsquo;s some kind of nerdish word,
That laws beyond his skills reside,
To comprehend them must he bide?</p>
<p>He watched his masters' progress fast,
And from their teachings came at last,
A need to focus, to persevere,
Work diligently, no time to veer,
For only with hard work and time,
Can knowledge fill his mind sublime.</p>
<p>Sighing he rose, no more to pout,
To code anew, no time to doubt,
For if success he wished to see,
He must work long and hard and free,
To bring his ideas to life,
He must with courage take the strife.</p>
